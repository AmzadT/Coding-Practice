**What Exactly Linked List is?** 
A Linked List is a linear data structure that includes a series of connected nodes. Each node in linked list two things, one is the **data (value)** and second is the **address** **(next)** of the next node, basically in simpler terms a link to the next  node.

The linked list data structure value can be of any data type (string, number, boolean, object, etc).

It has two pointers **HEAD** and **TAIL** which represents the first and the last node respectively.


# Types of Linked List
Basically there are 3 types of linked list:

- **Singly Linked List:** Each node contains only one pointer to the next node. Basically it is unidirectional.
- **Doubly Linked Lists**: Each node contains two pointers, a pointer to the next node and a pointer to the previous node. It is bidirectional.
- **Circular Linked Lists**: Circular linked lists are a variation of a linked list in which the last node points to the first node.


# Few Methods that can be use

**getFirst()**
This method would simply return the first node in the Linked List.

**getLast()**
This method would basically return the last node in the Linked List

**Size()**
This method will basically return the number of nodes in a Linked List when used.

**clear()**
This would basically clear the Linked List
