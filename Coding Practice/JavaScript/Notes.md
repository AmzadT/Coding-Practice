JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language used to make web pages interactive. It is a client-side and server-side scripting language that runs in the browser and on the backend (using Node.js). JavaScript follows the ECMAScript standard and supports features like dynamic typing, first-class functions, event-driven programming, and object-oriented programming. It is widely used for building web applications, handling user interactions, manipulating the DOM (Document Object Model), and making API calls.
