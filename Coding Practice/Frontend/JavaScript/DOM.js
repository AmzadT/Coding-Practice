// What is JavaScript?
// JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex things on web pages


// DOM
// The DOM is one of the most-used APIs on the Web because it allows code running in a browser to access and interact with every element in the document. Elements can be created, moved and changed. Event listeners can be added to elements and triggered on occurrence of a given event.
// Represented by a tree structure of all the elements created by the browser
// We can use javascript to manipulate/read/write the DOM
