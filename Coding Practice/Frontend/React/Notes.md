# What is JSX
 - javascript XML
 - Fundamentally JSX just makes working with React.createElement much easier and developer friendly. Now, what is this React.createElement? Let’s assume that we want to create a layout like this in our webpage using simple HTML, CSS, and Javascript



# useState
 - The `useState` hook in React is used to add state to a functional component. It allows you to create variables that React will watch for changes and automatically update the UI when those variables change.

   **What is State?**
    State is a way to store and manage data in a React component.
    When the state changes, React re-renders the component to reflect the updated data.

   **Why Use useState?**
    In React functional components, you can't use the this.state like in class components. Instead, you use the useState hook to create and update state.

    ```jsx
       const [state, setState] = useState(initialValue);
       import React, { useState } from 'react';

        function Counter() {
        const [count, setCount] = useState(0); // Step 1: Create state with initial value 0

        const increment = () => {
            setCount(count + 1); // Step 3: Update state using setCount
        };

        return (
            <div>
            <p>Count: {count}</p> {/* Step 2: Use state in the UI */}
            <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
            </div>
        );
        }

        export default Counter;

    ```


# useMemo
 - The `useMemo` hook in React is used to optimize performance by memoizing the result of a computation. This means React will remember the result of a function and only recompute it if its dependencies change. It helps avoid unnecessary calculations on every render, especially for expensive or complex operations.

    **Why Use useMemo?**
    React re-renders components when their state or props change. If a component has a heavy calculation, it might slow down your app because the calculation will run every time the component renders.

    With useMemo, you can tell React to "remember" the result of a calculation and only recompute it when needed.

    ```jsx
       const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => computeValue, [dependencies]);
       import React from 'react';

    function ExpensiveComponent({ items }) {
    const calculateSum = () => {
        console.log('Calculating sum...');
        return items.reduce((sum, item) => sum + item, 0);
    };

    const sum = calculateSum(); // This recalculates every render

    return <div>Sum: {sum}</div>;
    }

     
    **With useMemo (Optimized):**
    import React, { useMemo } from 'react';

    function ExpensiveComponent({ items }) {
    const sum = useMemo(() => {
        console.log('Calculating sum...');
        return items.reduce((sum, item) => sum + item, 0);
    }, [items]); // Only recalculates if `items` changes

    return <div>Sum: {sum}</div>;
    }

    ```

    **When to Use useMemo?**
    Expensive Computations:

    Use it when you have a heavy calculation that doesn't need to run on every render.
    Example: Sorting a large array, filtering data, or complex mathematical operations.
    Avoiding Re-Renders:

    Use it to stabilize values that are passed to child components as props to avoid unnecessary re-renders.


    **Without useMemo:**
    ```jsx
     function Parent({ items }) {
    const filteredItems = items.filter(item => item.active);

    return <Child data={filteredItems} />;
    }
    ```
    `The Child component will re-render every time Parent renders, even if items hasn’t changed.`

    **With useMemo:**
    ```jsx
    function Parent({ items }) {
    const filteredItems = useMemo(() => items.filter(item => item.active), [items]);

    return <Child data={filteredItems} />;
    }
    ```
   ` Now, filteredItems is only recalculated if items changes, reducing unnecessary renders.`




# useReducer
 - The `useReducer` hook in React is used to manage more complex state logic in your components. It is an alternative to useState when you have a state that depends on multiple actions or needs more structured updates.
  
    ```jsx
    - const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);
    - import { useReducer } from 'react';

    // Step 1: Define the reducer function
    function reducer(state, action) {
    switch (action.type) {
        case 'increment':
        return { count: state.count + 1 };
        case 'decrement':
        return { count: state.count - 1 };
        default:
        throw new Error('Unknown action type');
    }
    }

    function Counter() {
    // Step 2: Use the useReducer hook
    const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, { count: 0 });

    return (
        <div>
        <p>Count: {state.count}</p>
        {/* Step 3: Dispatch actions */}
        <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'increment' })}>Increment</button>
        <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'decrement' })}>Decrement</button>
        </div>
    );
    }

    ```

    **Why Use useReducer?**
    Better for Complex Logic:

    When the state has multiple pieces (e.g., a form with many inputs).
    When updates depend on the current state (e.g., toggling or resetting).
    Keeps Code Organized:

    The logic for updating the state is centralized in the reducer function.
    Predictable State Updates:

    Actions and reducers make it easier to debug and test your state logic.

    **When to Use useReducer?**
    When the state is complex or has multiple sub-values.
    When the state changes involve multiple actions.
    For better scalability and readability in larger components.



# useRef
 - The `useRef` hook in React is used to create a reference to a DOM element or a value that persists across renders without causing the component to re-render when the value changes.
  
  ```jsx
    **Example 1: Accessing a DOM Element**

    const ref = useRef(initialValue);
    import React, { useRef } from 'react';

    function FocusInput() {
    const inputRef = useRef(null); // Step 1: Create a ref

    const handleFocus = () => {
        inputRef.current.focus(); // Step 3: Use the ref to access the DOM element
    };

    return (
        <div>
        <input ref={inputRef} type="text" placeholder="Type something" /> {/* Step 2: Attach the ref */}
        <button onClick={handleFocus}>Focus Input</button>
        </div>
    );
    }

    export default FocusInput;


    **Example 2: Storing a Mutable Value**

    import React, { useRef, useState } from 'react';

    function Counter() {
    const countRef = useRef(0); // Step 1: Create a ref to hold the count
    const [dummy, setDummy] = useState(0); // Just to trigger re-renders

    const increment = () => {
        countRef.current += 1; // Step 2: Update the ref value
        console.log('Count:', countRef.current); // Logs the updated count
        setDummy(dummy + 1); // Step 3: Trigger a re-render (optional)
    };

    return (
        <div>
        <p>Count (not causing re-render): {countRef.current}</p>
        <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
        </div>
    );
    }

    export default Counter;


  ```

    **When to Use useRef?**
    Accessing DOM Elements:

    Focusing, scrolling, or manipulating DOM elements directly.
    Storing Mutable Values:

    To keep track of values (like a counter or a timer) that don’t need to trigger re-renders.
    Avoiding Re-Renders:

    For performance optimization when you need to store data without causing the component to re-render.

    It’s like a “box” that can hold a value or a reference to an element, and you can access or update it directly.

    Use it when you need direct access to a DOM element.




1. Camel Case
 - Definition: The first word is in lowercase, and subsequent words are capitalized.
 - `userName`
 - `getUserData`
 - `isLoggedIn`

2. Snake Case
 - Definition: All words are in lowercase and separated by underscores (_).
 - `user_name`
 - `get_user_data`
 - `is_logged_in`

3. Pascal Case
 - Definition: Every word starts with an uppercase letter, including the first word.
 - `UserName`
 - `GetUserData`
 - `IsLoggedIn`

# Where Each is Commonly Used:

**Camel Case:**
Common in JavaScript for variable and function names.
Example: let userName = "John";

**Snake Case:**
Common in Python for variable and function names.
Example: user_name = "John"

**Pascal Case:**
Common in C#, Java, and for naming classes in many languages.
Example: class UserLoginStatus { ... }


# What is Virtual DOM?
The Virtual DOM is a concept used in modern JavaScript libraries like React to improve the performance of updating the user interface (UI). It acts as a lightweight copy of the real DOM

# Why Use Virtual DOM?
Efficiency: Direct manipulation of the real DOM is slow. The virtual DOM minimizes these interactions.
Performance: By batching updates and optimizing changes, React ensures smooth performance.
Abstraction: Developers don't have to worry about manually updating the DOM; React handles it for you.


# What is Node Environment?
The Node environment refers to the runtime environment provided by Node.js, which allows you to execute JavaScript code outside of a web browser.

# Why is Node Environment Important?
It allows developers to:
Build backend services (e.g., APIs).
Perform file system operations.
Run build tools (e.g., Webpack, Babel).
Create full-stack applications using JavaScript.



**Virtual DOM**	                                           **Node Environment**
Used in React for UI optimization.	            Used for running JavaScript outside the browser.
Manages changes to the browser DOM.	            Provides tools to build backend applications.
Improves rendering performance.	                Handles server-side operations.



# What is a Framework?
A framework is a pre-defined structure or set of tools that provides a foundation for building applications. It dictates the architecture and flow of your application, meaning you follow its rules and patterns to build your project.

# What is a Library?
A library is a collection of pre-written code that helps you perform specific tasks. Unlike a framework, you control the flow of the application, and you decide when and how to use the library.

# Summary:
`Framework`: Provides a structure and dictates how your application should be built.
`Library`: Offers tools to solve specific problems, giving you more flexibility to structure your application.



# Why Use Express Instead of HTTP for Server Creation?
Node.js provides a built-in http module that allows you to create a server. While it works perfectly fine for basic server needs, Express.js is a framework built on top of Node.js to simplify and enhance server creation. 

3. **Middleware Support**
Middleware functions in Express allow you to process requests and responses easily, such as parsing JSON, handling errors, or adding authentication. In the http module, you need to implement such features manually.

4. **Scalability and Extensibility**
Express is designed to be modular and extensible, with a large ecosystem of plugins and libraries for tasks like authentication, logging, and more. The http module doesn’t provide this flexibility out of the box.

5. **Error Handling**
Express provides a centralized way to handle errors using middleware, making it easier to debug and manage errors.

6. **Community and Ecosystem**
Express has a large community and ecosystem of plugins and tools, making it easy to add features like authentication, database connections, and logging.
The http module is low-level and doesn’t have such an ecosystem.



# What are Middlewares in Express?
In Express.js, middleware refers to functions that have access to the request (req), response (res), and the next function in the request-response cycle. Middleware functions are used to process requests before they reach the final route handler or after the route handler has processed them.

Middleware functions in Express allow you to process requests and responses easily, such as parsing JSON, handling errors, or adding authentication. In the http module, you need to implement such features manually.

**Summary of Middleware Uses**
Request Logging: Log details of each request.
Authentication: Check if the user is authenticated before proceeding to route handlers.
Body Parsing: Parse incoming request bodies (e.g., JSON, URL-encoded).
Error Handling: Catch and handle errors.
CORS: Handle cross-origin requests.
Serving Static Files: Serve files like images, stylesheets, and scripts.



# What is JWT (JSON Web Token)?
JWT (JSON Web Token) is a compact, URL-safe, and self-contained way to securely transmit information between two parties (e.g., a client and a server) as a JSON object. It is commonly used for authentication and authorization in web applications.

   **Structure of a JWT:**
    A JWT consists of three parts, separated by dots (.):

   `Header:`
    Contains metadata about the token, such as the type (JWT) and the signing algorithm (e.g., HS256).
    {
    "alg": "HS256",
    "typ": "JWT"
    }

   `Payload`:
    Contains the claims (data) you want to transmit, such as user information or permissions.
    {
    "userId": "12345",
    "role": "admin",
    "exp": 1712345678
    }

   `Signature`:
    Ensures the token hasn’t been tampered with. It’s generated using a secret key (or private key) and the header + payload.
   `HMACSHA256(base64UrlEncode(header) + "." + base64UrlEncode(payload), secret)`
    A complete JWT looks like this:

   `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VySWQiOiIxMjM0NSIsInJvbGUiOiJhZG1pbiIsImV4cCI6MTcxMjM0NTY3OH0.sQp3tP7OIQ0Zc6f8tHxpt4A2FS4PdKHscS1fMwF5W9Q`


   **Why Do We Use JWT?**
    `Authentication`:
    JWT is widely used for user authentication. After a user logs in, the server generates a JWT containing the user's information and sends it to the client.
    The client includes this token in the headers (usually in the Authorization header) for every subsequent request.

   `Authorization`:
    JWT can store user roles or permissions, allowing the server to determine if a user has access to a specific resource.



# What are Components in React?
In React, components are the building blocks of the user interface (UI). They allow you to split the UI into independent, reusable pieces that can be managed separately. Each component represents a part of the UI and can have its own logic, structure, and styling.

# What are Props in React?
In React, props (short for properties) are the mechanism by which data is passed from a parent component to a child component. Props allow components to be dynamic and reusable, enabling them to receive different values and render accordingly.

**Summary**
`Components` are the heart of React applications and allow you to build UIs by breaking them down into smaller, reusable pieces.

`Components` can be either functional or class-based, with functional components becoming the preferred approach due to the introduction of hooks.

`Props` allow components to receive data from their parent components, while state allows components to manage their own data and re-render when it changes.



# What is DOM in JavaScript?
The `DOM` (Document Object Model) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the structure of a web page as a tree of objects, where each object corresponds to a part of the page, such as an element, attribute, or text content. The DOM allows programming languages like JavaScript to interact with and manipulate the content, structure, and style of web pages dynamically.

# Why is the DOM Important?
The DOM is crucial for dynamic web pages because it allows JavaScript to interact with the page after it has been loaded. This interaction is essential for creating interactive, real-time web applications, such as:
`Form validation` (checking user input before submitting)
`Dynamic content` updates (updating parts of the page without reloading the entire page)
`Animations` (changing element styles over time)
`Event handling` (responding to user interactions like clicks, keystrokes, etc.)


# What are Attributes in HTML?
In HTML, attributes provide additional information about HTML elements. They define properties or characteristics of elements and are specified within the opening tag of an element. Attributes are used to control the behavior, appearance, or functionality of an element.
 - `Name`: The name of the attribute (e.g., href, src, alt, class, id).


# Client-Server Model / Request-Response Cycle
The client-server model is a fundamental architecture used in networked applications, where two entities (clients and servers) interact to provide services or resources. This model is the foundation of most web-based applications and is the basis for how data is exchanged over the internet.

**Client-Server Model**
`Client`: The client is typically a user's device (e.g., a browser, mobile app, or desktop application) that requests resources or services from a server. The client initiates the communication by sending a request.

`Server`: The server is a system (often a computer or cloud service) that stores data or provides services. It listens for requests from clients and responds with the requested data or performs the required action.

**In this model:**
 - The client sends a request for data or services.
 - The server processes the request and sends back a response.
