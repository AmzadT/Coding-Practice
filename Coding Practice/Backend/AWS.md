## DNS - Domain Name System

DNS (Domain Name System) is a hierarchical and decentralized naming system for Internet connected resources. DNS maintains a list of domain names along with the resources, such as IP addresses, that are associated with them.

What is a Domain Name?
======================

Domain names are a key part of the Internet infrastructure. They provide a human-readable address for any web server available on the Internet.

Any Internet-connected computer can be reached through a public IP address, either an IPv4 address (e.g. 173.194.121.32) or an IPv6 address (e.g., 2027:0da8:8b73:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:1337).

Computers can handle such addresses easily, but people have a hard time finding out who's running the server or what service the website offers. IP addresses are hard to remember and might change over time.

To solve all those problems we use human-readable addresses called domain names.



### DNS Prefetch

DNS-prefetch is an attempt to resolve domain names before resources get requested. This could be a file loaded later or link target a user tries to follow.

When a browser requests a resource from a (third party) server, that cross-originâ€™s domain name must be resolved to an IP address before the browser can issue the request. This process is known as DNS resolution. While DNS caching can help to reduce this latency, DNS resolution can add significant latency to requests. For websites that open connections to many third parties, this latency can significantly reduce loading performance.

dns-prefetch helps developers mask DNS resolution latency. The HTML element offers this functionality by way of a rel attribute value of dns-prefetch. The cross-origin domain is then specified in the href attribute:
