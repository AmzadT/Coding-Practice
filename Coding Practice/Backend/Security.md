## Security Questions:

1. What is HTTPS? What is the difference between HTTP and HTTPS?
HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure) is an extension of HTTP. It uses encryption (via SSL/TLS) to secure data being transferred between a browser and a web server.
Difference:
HTTP: Data is sent in plain text, which can be intercepted and read.
HTTPS: Data is encrypted, making it secure from interception or attacks like man-in-the-middle.


2. What is SSL/TLS?
SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and TLS (Transport Layer Security) are cryptographic protocols used to secure communications over a network.
They ensure:
Encryption: Data remains private.
Authentication: Ensures the server you're communicating with is genuine.
Integrity: Ensures the data is not tampered with during transmission.
TLS is an updated, more secure version of SSL.



3. What is CORS?
CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a browser security feature that controls how resources (like APIs) can be requested from a domain different from the one serving the web page.
Example: If your frontend hosted on example.com wants to access an API at api.example.com, CORS policies must allow this cross-origin request.



4. What is OWASP?
OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) is a global non-profit organization that focuses on improving the security of software.
It provides:
Resources: Guides and tools for developers.
OWASP Top 10: A widely recognized list of the top 10 most critical security risks to web applications.
Educational Materials: To help developers build secure systems.
