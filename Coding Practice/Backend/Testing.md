- **What is testing?**
    - Testing is the process of evaluating a software application or system to identify any defects or errors between the expected and actual results.
    - The responsibility of testing is to point out the issues of bugs and give developers a clue to help them fix them right following the requirements.
    - Testing involves executing the software application or system with a set of predefined inputs and verifying that the outputs match the expected results.
    - It involves a range of activities, such as -
        - designing test cases,
        - creating test data,
        - executing test cases, and
        - reporting defects.


- **What is unit testing?**
    - Unit testing is a type of software testing, where an individual unit of software is tested.
    - A **unit** is the smallest testable part of any software.
    - The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed.
    - **Unit Testing** makes the development of the software faster.


- **What is functional testing?**
    - Functional Testing is defined as a type of testing that verifies that each **function**
     of the software application is working correctly and meets the specified functional requirements.
    - The purpose of functional testing is to validate that the software behaves as expected and performs the intended functions and tasks.
    - It focuses on manual testing as well as automation testing.
    - Functional Testing involves checking the following:
        - User Interface
        - APIs
        - Database
        - Security
        - Client/ server applications
        - The functionality of the Application Under Test
