Node.js Questions
1. What is the difference between readFile and readFileSync?
readFile:

Asynchronous.
Doesn't block other operations while reading the file.
Example:
javascript
Copy code
const fs = require('fs');
fs.readFile('example.txt', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log(data);
});
readFileSync:

Synchronous.
Blocks execution until the file is read.
Example:
javascript
Copy code
const fs = require('fs');
const data = fs.readFileSync('example.txt', 'utf8');
console.log(data);
2. How can you make a network request using the http module?
Use Node.js's built-in http module to send requests.
javascript
Copy code
const http = require('http');
const options = {
  hostname: 'example.com',
  port: 80,
  path: '/',
  method: 'GET'
};

const req = http.request(options, res => {
  let data = '';
  res.on('data', chunk => (data += chunk));
  res.on('end', () => console.log(data));
});

req.on('error', error => console.error(error));
req.end();
3. How to create a web server without Express?
Use the http module to create a basic web server.
javascript
Copy code
const http = require('http');

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });
  res.end('Hello, World!');
});

server.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server running on http://localhost:3000'));
4. What are timers in Node.js?
Timers are functions for scheduling tasks:
setTimeout: Executes a function after a delay.
setInterval: Repeats a function at regular intervals.
setImmediate: Executes a function immediately after the current event loop phase.
javascript
Copy code
setTimeout(() => console.log('After 2 seconds'), 2000);
setInterval(() => console.log('Every 1 second'), 1000);
5. What is NVM? How do you use it?
NVM (Node Version Manager):
A tool to manage multiple Node.js versions.
Usage:
Install using the official NVM repository.
Install a Node.js version: nvm install 14.
Switch versions: nvm use 14.
6. What is CommonJS? How is it different from ES Modules?
CommonJS:

Default module system in Node.js.
Uses require and module.exports.
javascript
Copy code
const fs = require('fs'); // CommonJS
ES Modules:

Newer, used in modern JavaScript.
Uses import and export.
javascript
Copy code
import fs from 'fs'; // ES Modules
7. How does the crypto module work?
The crypto module provides encryption and hashing utilities.
Example: Generating a hash.
javascript
Copy code
const crypto = require('crypto');
const hash = crypto.createHash('sha256').update('password').digest('hex');
console.log(hash);
8. What are WebSockets?
WebSockets:
A communication protocol for real-time data exchange between the client and server.
Full-duplex (two-way) communication.
Example using ws library:
javascript
Copy code
const WebSocket = require('ws');
const server = new WebSocket.Server({ port: 8080 });

server.on('connection', socket => {
  socket.on('message', message => console.log(`Received: ${message}`));
  socket.send('Hello from server');
});
9. What are Microservices?
Microservices:
Architecture style where applications are divided into small, independent services.
Each service focuses on a specific functionality.
Communicate using APIs.
10. Creating a CLI-based app using Node.js and publishing it
Create a CLI app using process.argv for arguments and commander for advanced features.
Example:
javascript
Copy code
#!/usr/bin/env node

const [,, ...args] = process.argv;
console.log(`Hello, ${args.join(' ')}`);
Publishing:
Add a bin field in package.json to specify the executable file.
Run npm publish to publish it to npm.

Mongoose Questions
1. How do you create indexes with Mongoose?
In Mongoose, indexes are created to improve the speed of data retrieval operations (like find queries) on large datasets. Here's how you can create an index:

Creating an index manually: You can define an index for a schema field by using the .index() method:

javascript
Copy code
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  username: { type: String, required: true },
  email: { type: String, required: true, unique: true }
});

userSchema.index({ username: 1 }); // Creates an ascending index on the "username" field

const User = mongoose.model('User', userSchema);
Creating unique indexes: For fields like email or username, where you want to ensure no duplicates, you can set the unique option:

javascript
Copy code
userSchema.index({ email: 1 }, { unique: true });
Using compound indexes: If you need to create an index on multiple fields, you can specify them in an object:

javascript
Copy code
userSchema.index({ firstName: 1, lastName: 1 });
Creating indexes with createIndexes(): You can also manually trigger index creation when the schema is saved for the first time:

javascript
Copy code
mongoose.model('User', userSchema).createIndexes();
2. What are pre and post-hooks?
In Mongoose, pre-hooks and post-hooks are middleware functions that are executed before or after certain operations (like saving, updating, or deleting a document) are performed on a model. These hooks allow you to add custom logic, such as validation or logging, at specific points in the lifecycle of a document.

Pre-hooks: Run before a certain operation (e.g., save, validate, remove, etc.) takes place.

Example: Using a pre hook to hash a password before saving a user document.

javascript
Copy code
userSchema.pre('save', function(next) {
  if (this.isModified('password')) {
    this.password = hashPassword(this.password); // hypothetical hash function
  }
  next(); // Move to the next operation (save)
});
Post-hooks: Run after a certain operation has completed.

Example: Using a post hook to log after a document is saved.

javascript
Copy code
userSchema.post('save', function(doc) {
  console.log(`User ${doc.username} has been saved.`);
});
Common Operations:

pre('save'): Runs before a document is saved.
post('save'): Runs after a document is saved.
pre('remove'): Runs before a document is removed.
post('remove'): Runs after a document is removed.
Pre-hooks are typically used for modifying the document or performing actions before the main operation, such as validation or encryption. Post-hooks are useful for logging, cleaning up resources, or performing actions after the operation has completed.

- **What are some templating engines?**
- **What are routes?**

1. How do you do validations?
Validations are used to ensure the correctness of data before saving it in a database or processing it in your application.

In Frontend (JavaScript): Validations are done to check user inputs before sending them to the server. For example:

javascript
Copy code
const email = "test@example.com";
if (!email.includes("@")) {
  console.log("Invalid email!");
}
In Backend (e.g., Node.js with Mongoose): Validations are applied at the database schema level to ensure data integrity. Example:

javascript
Copy code
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  email: { type: String, required: true, unique: true, match: /.+@.+\..+/ },
  age: { type: Number, min: 18, max: 60 }
});
Using Libraries: Tools like Joi or Express-validator are used in Node.js for detailed validations.

javascript
Copy code
const Joi = require('joi');

const schema = Joi.object({
  email: Joi.string().email().required(),
  age: Joi.number().min(18).max(60).required(),
});

const { error } = schema.validate({ email: "test@example", age: 17 });
if (error) console.log(error.details);
2. What are some templating engines?
Templating engines are tools that allow you to generate dynamic HTML by embedding JavaScript logic in the HTML templates. They help in creating dynamic content easily.

Examples of Templating Engines:
EJS (Embedded JavaScript): Syntax is similar to regular HTML, with JavaScript embedded:
html
Copy code
<h1>Welcome, <%= user.name %></h1>
Pug (formerly Jade): Uses indentation-based syntax:
pug
Copy code
h1 Welcome #{user.name}
Handlebars: Focuses on cleaner logic with minimal code:
html
Copy code
<h1>Welcome, {{user.name}}</h1>
These engines make it easier to build dynamic pages by separating HTML from the server-side logic.

3. What are routes?
Routes in web development define how the application responds to a client's request to a specific endpoint (URL + HTTP method).
